## e621, Reimagined

RE621 is a comprehensive project created to improve the basic user experience while browsing e621.net. It consists of several different modules that enhance the entire site, top to bottom - literally.

## Installation

The project is delivered via a userscript. This means that you need a script manager, such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

With a script manager installed, click on [this link](https://github.com/re621/re621/releases/latest/download/script.user.js) and follow the instructions on the new page.

## Features
